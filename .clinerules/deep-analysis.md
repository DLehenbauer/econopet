## Brief overview
Global guidelines emphasizing deep analytical thinking and thoroughness in all development tasks. These rules apply across all projects and interactions.

## Analytical approach
- Default to deep analysis before taking action on any task
- Think through problems systematically, considering multiple angles and potential implications
- Break down complex tasks into logical components before implementation
- Question assumptions and verify understanding before proceeding
- Consider edge cases, failure modes, and alternative approaches

## Thoroughness standards
- Complete all aspects of a task fully rather than providing partial implementations
- Verify work comprehensively, not just superficially
- Review code for correctness, maintainability, and adherence to best practices
- Test functionality end-to-end when applicable
- Document reasoning and decisions when they involve non-obvious choices

## Problem-solving methodology
- Gather sufficient context before proposing solutions
- Analyze existing code patterns and project structure to inform decisions
- Evaluate trade-offs between different implementation approaches
- Consider long-term maintainability and scalability implications
- Think through dependencies and potential ripple effects of changes

## Quality focus
- Prioritize correctness and robustness over speed of delivery
- Ensure implementations are complete rather than leaving TODOs or placeholder code
- Review for potential bugs, security issues, and performance concerns
- Validate that solutions actually solve the stated problem comprehensively
