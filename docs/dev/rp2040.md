## Oscillator

With a 1K resistor, YSX321SL requires XOSC workaround:
```cmake
# EconoPET 40/8096 Rev. A: xosc requires a little extra time to stabilize.
# On tested sample (45240-60), 8ms was intermittent and 16ms was reliable.
# 64ms provides a large tolerance.

```

Anecdotally, [this project](https://github.com/Swyter/psdaptwor/tree/master) claims that 100 ohm + 33pF is "known good".  (4-layer)
