# Rev B. TODOs

* HW Design
  * 1K resistor likely too big for YSX321SL
    * Try removing/shorting resistor to see if value too large.
    * Possibly you can compare with recommended crystal to estimate new value?
* Silkscreen
  * Front:
    * Consider adding boxes for SSN (`[] [] [] [] [] - [] []`).
  * Back:
    * Label remaining ports (IEEE, USER, KEYBOARD, etc.)
    * Label remaining pins (C[7:0], R[9:0], etc)
