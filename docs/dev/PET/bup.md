# Bring-Up Notes

With just CPU, RAM and ROM the Commodore PET will boot to the Terminal interface Monitor (TIM).

It enters the TIM because the ROM reads that status of PIA1/PA7 to determine if the DIAG pin is pulled low:

```asm
FD3E LDA $E810  ; Read PIA1 Port A (normally returns $ff)
FD41 BMI $FD46  ; Test PA7 (UserPort pin 5) -- bit 7 = DIAGÂ (0: TIM, 1: BASIC)
FD43 JMP $D472  ; Jump to MONITOR
FD46 JMP $D3B6  ; Jump to BASIC initialization
```

With PIA1 (or a kludge to return 1xxx_xxxx) the boot will continue to the BASIC prompt.
However, there will be no cursor or keyboard input.
This is because the Editor ROM scans the keyboard and blinks the cursor in response to interrupts.
These interrupts are generated by feeding V-Sync to PIA1 CB1 (pin 18).
There are two ways to proceed:

* Hack: Directly generate IRQBs for the CPU at ~60 Hz.
* Add PIA1 and provide it with a ~60 Hz V-Sync on CB1 / pin 18.
