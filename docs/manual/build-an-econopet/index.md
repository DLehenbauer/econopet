# Build an EconoPET

EconoPET is an open-hardware replacement mainboard for Commodore PET/CBM computers. This section walks through the end-to-end build process: ordering boards and parts, assembling the hardware, then installing the firmware.

> **WARNING:** Rev A is not perfect. Before ordering, review the [known issues](https://github.com/DLehenbauer/econopet/issues?q=state%3Aopen%20label%3A40%2F8096-A) and understand this list may grow as more people build and use the project.

There are four main steps:

1. [Ordering PCBs from JLCPCB](ordering-pcbs-from-jlcpcb.md)
1. [Ordering parts from Mouser](ordering-parts-from-mouser.md)
1. [Assembling the board](assembling-the-board.md)
1. [Installing the firmware](installing-the-firmware.md)

Building an EconoPET requires some basic soldering skills and comfort with flashing firmware to a microcontroller. It is recommended that you read through all four steps before ordering parts to ensure you are comfortable with the full process.
