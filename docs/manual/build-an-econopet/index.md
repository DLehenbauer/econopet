# Build an EconoPET

> **⚠️ Warning:** Rev A is not perfect. Before ordering, review the currently [known issues](https://github.com/DLehenbauer/econopet/issues?q=state%3Aopen%20label%3A40%2F8096-A) and understand that new issues may be discovered over time.

Building an EconoPET requires ordering PCBs from a manufacturer, some basic soldering skills and flashing firmware to a microcontroller. It is recommended that you read through all steps before ordering parts to ensure you are comfortable with the full process.

## Build Process

The steps to build an EconoPET are:

1. [Ordering PCBs from JLCPCB](ordering-pcbs-from-jlcpcb.md)
1. [Ordering parts from Mouser](ordering-parts-from-mouser.md)
1. [Assembling the board](assembling-the-board.md)
1. [Installing the firmware](installing-the-firmware.md)

## Cost

The total cost to build an EconoPET fluctuates.  The best way to get an accurate estimate is to follow the steps in [Ordering PCBs from JLCPCB](ordering-pcbs-from-jlcpcb.md) and [Ordering parts from Mouser](ordering-parts-from-mouser.md) up to the point of checkout, where you can see an up-to-date total before placing the order.

But as a rough guideline, the table below breaks down the per-board cost of my most recent order, which was placed in February 2025 (prior to the recent import tariffs going into effect in the US).

| Item | Cost | Percentage |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| TH DIP ICs | $48.45 | 36.61% |
| TH Other Components | $23.09 | 17.45% |
| PCBA Global Sourcing (FPGA) | $15.99 | 12.08% |
| Tax | $12.25 | 9.25% |
| PCBA Components | $8.06 | 6.09% |
| Shipping from JLCPCB | $7.57 | 5.72% |
| PCBA Loading Fee* | $4.80 | 3.63% |
| Shipping from Mouser | $3.26 | 2.47% |
| Tariff | $2.35 | 1.77% |
| PCB | $2.16 | 1.63% |
| PCBA SMT Assembly | $1.63 | 1.23% |
| PCBA Setup Fee* | $1.60 | 1.21% |
| PCB Engineering Fee* | $0.80 | 0.60% |
| PCBA Stencil* | $0.30 | 0.23% |
| PCBA Special Component Fee | $0.03 | 0.02% |
| **Total** | **$132.34** | |

Items marked with * are one-time fees that will ammortize towards zero with higher volume orders.
